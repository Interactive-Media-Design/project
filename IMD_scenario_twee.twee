:: Artistic intro {"position":"825,700","size":"100,100"}
At the Certosa we can see the evolution of taste over the years trought  the eyes of the most important artists of Bologna, from the tombs of the early ninetheen century, almost devoid of religious symbols, to eccentric burials in the Retour d’Egypte style, through the art Noveau, to the Rationalism of the twentieh century with the colossal monument to The Fallen of the Great War.
But dispite the changing paradigm of taste during time, what remains a constant in the cemetery is the wish to honour the deceased with a tomb that represent him, sometimes  in a more allegorical way and sometimes more directly, but in a way that still makes tribute to his life and his work, and to the family itself.
An example of this type is the not so know  <span style="color: yellow;">[[Tomb of Eduardo Weber]]</span> , in choister 1.

<center><div class="info">Benvenuti al Cimitero Monumentale della Certosa. Sono qui per farti compagnia nel tragitto fino al Cortile della Chiesa, da dove potrai iniziare la tua esperienza. Nel frattempo, goditi il silenzio di questi spazi e lascia che ti racconti qualcosa su questo posto.
La Certosa di Bologna, fondata nel 1801, è stato il primo cimitero monumentale in Italia. Le sue bellissime sale, chiostri e opere d’arte hanno attratto i viaggiatori durante il Grand Tour e sono state celebrate da numerosi autori, come Giosuè Carducci and Charles Dickens. 
Il primo nucleo del cimitero è stato edificato sull’area precedentemente occupata dal monastero certosino, chiuso nel 1796 da Napoleone. Il luogo attuale è il risultato di una stratificazione culturale che trova le sue radici nel sesto secolo avanti Cristo, quando l’area su cui il cimitero è stato eretto era usata come luogo di sepoltura dagli Etruschi.
Nel corso degli anni, il cimitero monumentale è stato interessato da diverse espansioni, in parte dovute alla necessità di accogliere credi diversi da quello cattolico. A partire dal 1833, vennero intrapresi nuovi piani per allargare il cimitero e nuovi spazi di ispirazione classica, come la Sala del Colombario, furono aggiunti all’area esistente.
Questo tipo di strutture trovò una diffusione ancora maggiore dopo l’unificazione dell’Italia, con spazi come la Galleria degli Angeli. Nel 1869, venne inaugurato il Cimitero Ebraico, mentre le necessità legate alla crescente diffusione della cremazione portò alla creazione dell’Ara crematoria e del Cinerario.
Dall’inizio del ventesimo secolo, il cimitero fu espanso verso la città, con l’edificazione dell’Ingresso Monumentale, vicino allo stadio, mentre la più consistente estensione durante il periodo fascista fu il Chiostro sesto.
L’ultima rilevante aggiunta si verificò in seguito alla Secondo Guerra Mondiale, con l’introduzione del Campo degli Ospedali, al cui centro è collocato il Monumento Ossario ai Caduti Partigiani, eretto nel 1959, e del Cimitero Moderno, nell’area occidentale della Certosa, che segna il passaggio dai monumenti funebri come memoria pubblica ai luoghi di sepoltura come memoria privata.

:: Barbieri Tomb {"position":"175,1150","size":"100,100"}
It was built in 1818 by Giovanni Putti, designed by the architect Angelo Venturoli. The sepulchral arch was purchased by the marquis Virgilio Davia, executor of the deceased Maria Caterina Isabella Barbieri widow Mattioli, in March 1817.
Virgilio Davia certainly interpreted the last wish of Isabella, who had taken care to set up a monument to herself and not to her husband.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Media-Design/project/raw/main/ARTISTIC%20PATH/BARBIERI.jpg" width="400">
</div>

Thanks to the prestigious role of adviser to the Archbishop of Cologne and Elector Palatine Maximilian Federigo, that the whimsical Isabella had managed to get her husband, in Bologna she was considered a lady of the upper middle class, well known and much talked about, who must have been on friendly terms with Giovanni Putti if on 4 September 1809 she was the godmother of the newborn Massimiliano, the second son of the sculptor who already enjoyed good fame. In the same year he had created the two Weeping to be placed on the pilates of the gate of the new entrance of the Certosa and was preparing to move to Milan where important public commissions awaited him.
The monument seems to refer, even in its details, to the works of Antonio Canova: for example, from the Florentine monument to Vittorio Alfieri the symbolic motif of the laurel wreath with ribbons placed in the tympanum of the sarcophagus is resumed, without variations. Canoviana is also the idea of the Allegory of Faith with the high wooden cross (which is however slender and trilobed, and has nothing of the essential and grandiose Christian sign of the monument to Clement XIII) to the right of the sarcophagus, despite the entire sculptural complex (Faith in fact, the Allegory of Prudence with the serpent and the mirror its attributes and, above all, the group of Charity connoted by intricate draperies) reveals the propensity of the plasticator towards popular and neo-baroque style styles.

The Galleria degli Angeli, designed by Zannoni between the seventies and eighties, is accessed from the north arm of the Cloister VII and the south arm of the Cloister III, through a pronaos that in the facades towards the cloisters has four Corinthian columns and triangular pediment, while towards the inside it has two Corinthian pillars to support the arches of the dome. The two arms of the tunnel start from the central bay and are closed to the east and west by small pronai with two columns. The arms have vaulted coffered vaults and square skylights, while the pronaos that connects them is covered with drawers with rosettes.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Media-Design/project/raw/main/ARTISTIC%20PATH/BISTEGHI.jpeg"alt="bisteghi" width="400">
</div>

Among the major Bolognese sculptors between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries present in the gallery is Enrico Barberi, who occupies the center of the spaces with the valuable monuments Bisteghi, 1891, Borghi Mamo, 1894, and Cavazza, 1894, surmounted by the crucified Christ in bronze and at the center of the central span.
The figure of the angel is highlighted in the foreground, from an impassive look. The arm indicates the dying who is ready to leave the earth for a new life. It is placed diagonally, just to represent the moment when the divine messenger is about to float in the air.
The details of the sheets and the different fabrics of the clothes suggest a school of thought similar to Lorenzo Bartolini.



The figure of the impassive woman, instead, upsets the dramatic moment of the story. It is probably due to the client, as in the original designs had not been thought in this way.
For its way of representing and sculpting, one could think that it belongs to the verista style. In reality, the influences of liberty are evident. Note, in particular, the dramatic choice of the scene and the features of the angel.

Moving forward, you have to know that the architect of the Certosa was Ercole Gasperini, who was inspired  by the neoclassicism and romanticism principles. The result is a monumental complex of great charm, characterized by wide and regular avenues, colonnaded arcades and numerous funeral chapels. And we can continue to perceive the idea of this historical-art movement in particular in the Cloister III.
The Cloister III or the Chapel, extended behind the apse of the church of San Girolamo, was built during the works of expansion of the original nucleus of the Carthusian monastery. After the suppression of the religious orders, Cloister III was the first to receive the tombs of the new public cemetery from 1801. At that time many monumental tombs were erected in the Renaissance cloister, entrusted to the most famous artists of the time, such as the architects Marchesini, Venturoli and Gasperini, the sculptors Putti and De Maria, the painters Fancelli and Basoli ,of the glorious Bolognese Academy of Fine Arts.

Over the decades there has been a preponderant realization of painted tombs - a real European unicum - which represent perspective views that often open on nature, where sarcophagi and funerary monuments stand. Since 1815, with the end of the Jacobin experience and the return of the papal government, there has been a radical change. The Academy of Fine Arts is called upon to approve the projects of the monuments and imposes the execution of monuments in sculpture, tolerating those in painting only if they imitated one in sculpture. Bologna was however a city where it was difficult and expensive to import large blocks of marble and it is for this reason that the Cloister III presents an impressive number of monuments in stucco, plaster and scagliola: another aspect that makes this place unique in the neoclassical panorama. Walking under the porch you can see the presence of some marble monuments and very few bronze: after the Unification of Italy the city starts a strong industrial development, allowing new families to erect monuments in valuable materials.

Reaching Cloister VI, you find yourself in a stunning space, impressive for its monumental architecture. You are right in front of the entrance, from where you can admire the dome on top of the Gallery that delimits the Cloister on the north side. Two grand statues on each side of the path are mounting the guard before the ossuaries behind them. Beyond this view, a staircase connects the path to an underground area presenting two allegorical sculptures on the side of the entrance.

:: Cloister VII {"position":"475,1450","size":"100,100"}
If the Cloister III met the neoclassical taste of the intellectual aristocracy of the early nineteenth century, the Cloister VII was designed for the needs of a city bourgeoisie that did not need large celebratory arches. Indicated in the plan of the second half of the nineteenth century of the Certosa as Campo dei Cholerosi, it is circumscribed to the north by the Galleria degli Angeli, to the south by the Galleria a Tre Navate, to the east by the Sala del Colombario and to the west by the Sala delle Catacombe. The cloister VII is the work of Antonio Zannoni as the Galleria degli Angeli, and takes up the neoclassical aesthetic. In the porticoed arms there are aesthetical and aulic monuments, while in the field, empty until the 1880s, the statuary of verista taste prevails (Monumento Gancia by Pietro Veronesi, 1896). The figures of the deceased who refer with dignity to their professions, according to a secular vision of life, act as a counterpoint to the statues of allegorical angels. 
Built in 1891 by the sculptor Diego Sarti to a design by Attilio Muggia, the Monumento Montanari stands out for its Dolente, one of the most emblematic sculptures in the cemetery.

At the center of Galleria Tre Navate, we have the monument of Enea Cochi, “ a young man with s generous heart” who died in 1867. 
The sculture is the work of Carlo Monari (1831-1918), defined in 1889 by de Gubernatis as “one of the most talented sculpultures of learned Bologna”. He is particularly present in the Certosa, having executed almost  30 works including small portraits,  busts and large sculputres. Here we can admire one of the best examples of the artist’s early production. Note the naturalness of the pose and the balanced measure that characterises the figure, portrayed in elegant modern clothing. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Media-Design/project/raw/main/ARTISTIC%20PATH/cocchi1.jpg"alt="cocchi1" width="400">
</div>

In the portrait of Enea, one can recognize the constituent and characteristic elements of 19th century men’s clothing, the classic three-piece: jacket, trousers and waistcoat. The jacket has wide lapels, a deep slit in the back and an applied border at the sides of the sleeves that matches the trousers, which are also embellished with a decorative stripe that follows the outer profile. The trousers represent the successor to the knee-length short trousers of the early 19the century (coulottes): tight at the knee and adherent to the leg. Over a shirt with a collar fastened by a tie, a waistcoat is worn in which one can see the presence of one of the most commonly used accessories among men of the 19th century period: the pocket watch. Its presence in fact “betrayed” by the chain that runs from the buttoning of the waistcoat to the breast pocket. 



The epigraph on the base remembers  him as follows: Here rest Enea Cocchi, a young man of generous heart and sharp intellect, hope and joy of his family, kidnapped at the age of 18 on 1 july 1867 from the love of his parents, How cruel you were , o death, that throught arcane ways you took away such a dear son from those who loved him so much, and from the poor who dying he recommended to his father’s pity.

Approaching this new tomb, an unsettling presence permeates the air. Whispers of their enigmatic practices and echoes of ancient rituals seem to linger in the shadows. Who are these people buried here?

This is the tomb of ''Anna Bonazinga and Pietro D'Amico''. 
Living between the 19th and 20th centuries, this Bolognese couple operated a "Magnetic Medical Cabinet" that became famous throughout the country. For forty years, they attracted seekers of alternative consultations. Pietro was a theorist and practitioner of <span style="color: darkviolet;">''mesmerism''</span>, a form of therapy based on the theory that all health revolved around a fluid, known as (text-style:"underline")[animal magnetism], that flowed through the human body, ensuring its proper function. Illnesses were thought to stem from disruptions in this flow, which needed to be in harmony with the universal fluid. To restore its mobility, magnets were applied to the body.
Anna Bonazinga, instead is considered one of the most influential <span style="color: darkviolet;">''psychics and clairvoyant''</span> of the period. In her sessions, Pietro would induce a (text-style:"underline")[magnetic sleep]—possibly a form of hypnosis—in Anna, during which she would prophesy remedies for various diseased. The couple even offered consultations by correspondence; one needed only to send a small fee, a description of the symptoms, and two hairs from the sick person.

But try to look closer to those people... can you see something particular?

This further step of this path brought you in front of the ''Frassetto Tomb''. Dedicated to the renowned anthropologist Fabio Frassetto (1876-1953) and his son who perished during World War II in an attempt to save a wounded comrade, this monument portrays them in an eternal dialogue on death.

Father and son, despite their stone forms, are communicating on a deep level. They lie in a silent and profound conversation. Fabio Frassetto, adorned in his scholarly toga, clutches a <span style="color: darkviolet;">''skull''</span>—an emblem of the topic of the discussion. Beside him, his son, a cavalry captain, holds his command baton, dressed in military attire.

Certosa is a place where the boundaries between the earthly world and the afterlife blend uniquely. This monumental cemetery, rich in history and symbolism, stands as a profound testament to the beliefs, values, and mysteries of those who have passed.

The tombs within the Certosa are not just final resting places but also symbolic containers of meaning. They mark the boundary between the past and the present, between the living and the dead. Through intricate designs and esoteric symbols, the deceased continue to communicate and transmit their ideals and beliefs to the community of the living.

In 2006, driven by the desire to unlock the secrets of his extraordinary voice, a team of researchers from the University of Bologna, in collaboration with experts from Pisa and York, ''exhumed his remains''. 

The bones of his lower limbs, a mandible, a femur, two teeth, and fragments of his skull were all that was left of the once-great Farinelli. These skeletal relics were analyzed to understand the physical consequences of his castration, revealing the profound impact it had on his body and health.

You have arrived at the next tomb, where the restless spirit of ''Francesco Albergati Capacelli'', an influential noble from 18th-century Bologna, awaits. 
Francesco Albergati Capacelli, born in 1728, was a man of culture and an active figure in the political and social spheres of his time. However, his life was marked by (text-style:"underline")[personal tragedies] that left deep scars on his soul. In Bernardo Gasparini's 1845 tale, <span style="color: darkviolet;">"Two Nights at the Certosa of Bologna"</span>, Albergati emerges as a ''ghost'' eager to recount his sorrowful story to the living, seeking redemption. 

Albergati's tragic tale revolves around his tumultuous marriage to Caterina Boccadabati. They wed in 1772 after the birth of their first son. Despite the initial joy, their marriage soon descended into a nightmarish existence. One fateful night, during a stay at their villa in Zola, a violent argument erupted between them. In a moment of despair and fury, Caterina(text-style:"underline")[ stabbed herself to death]. The gruesome scene left Albergati accused of her murder, though he was later exonerated after a thorough trial. Yet, the shadow of that night haunted him forever.

In Gasparini's story, Albergati's spirit, recognizing the living author wandering the Certosa, carches the opportunity to share his tale. His voice, filled with anguish and desperation, seeks to reclaim his honor and explain the torment he endured. The tragic memory of his wife’s suicide and the subsequent accusations are etched deeply into his restless soul.

As you stand before his tomb, you can almost hear the echoes of his pained confession. But at a certain point, Albergati's tormented tale gives way to an even more haunting song... are you brave enough to follow it?

As you step into the first cloister, you find yourself drawn to the imposing monument dedicated to ''Giovanni Guidi'', a colonist and soldier. The year is 1818, and Giovanni's earthly journey has come to an end due to illness. His final days were spent in captivity, succumbing to bronchial catarrh in a military hospital in Fiume.

Alfieri Maserati was an''Italian automotive engineer''
Alfieri Maserati was born in Voghera in 1887. In 1903 he and his brother Bindo started working for Isotta Fraschini in Milan. He followed his brother Carlo to Bianchi in 1905, with whom he raced and won in 1909. Alfieri and Ettore Maserati went back to Isotta Fraschini on a mission to Argentina in 1912, returning to Italy to found the new Milan-based workshop Societa Anonima Officine Alfieri Maserati in 1914. Both served in World War I and the workshop was run by his brother Ernesto Maserati, who led a large production of spark plugs to the war effort. After the war a larger production plant was set up in Bologna. Alfieri won many races. He was head mechanic for Diatto when he joined his brothers and they created the Maserati Tipo 26 based on the Diatto chassis he had brought. In 1927 while racing his Type 26, Alfieri lost control and the car overturned after hitting a ditch. Alfieri was gravely injured and one of his kidneys remained irreparably damaged. In 1932, during a poorly executed surgery on the remaining kidney, in March Alfieri died unexpectedly from complications in Ospedale Maggiore in Bologna. He is known as an Italian automotive engineer and for establishing and leading the Maserati racing car manufacturer with the other Maserati Brothers.

Erminia Borghi-Mamo was an'' italian soprano''.
She was born in Paris in 1855  and she was the daughter of 2 Italian opera singers. She was literally born into the theater because her mum Adelaide Borghi-Mamo finished a performance of Verdi's Il Trovatore, then gave birth to Erminia hours later, in a room within the theater. Erminia made her opera stage debut in 1873, in Nice, in “La forza del destino”. She was active in Italian opera for the next twenty years. "Still quite young, Mdlle. Borghi-Mamo is already mistress of the vocal art," an English writer reported in 1876. Her best-known roles included the title parts in Aida and Lucrezia Borgia, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, Margherita and Elena in Mefistofele, and Leonora in Il trovatore. Her last performance was in 1893.

Giorgio Morandi was an'' Italian painter and printmaker'' who specialized in still lifes. He was born in Bologna in 1890. He studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Bologna which based its traditions on 14th-century painting. He was excellent at his studies, although his professors disapproved. In 1910, he visited Florence where he was impressed by the works of artists such as Giotto, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, and Paolo Uccello. In 1915, he joined the army but had a breakdown and was indefinitely discharged. During World War I, Morandi's still life paintings became more reduced in their compositional elements and purer in form. 
He practiced metaphysical painting from that was his last major stylistic shift; thereafter, he focused increasingly on subtle gradations of hue, tone, and objects arranged in a unifying atmospheric haze, establishing the direction his art was to take for the rest of his life. 
Morandi was associated with the regional Strapaese group, a fascist-influenced group emphasizing local cultural traditions. Although his friendships with anti-Fascist figures led authorities to arrest him briefly in 1943.
Morandi exhibited his work in both Italian and foreign cities. 
He was quiet and polite in both his private and public life. He had an enigmatic yet very optimistic personality. Morandi died of lung cancer on June 1964. He is buried in the Certosa di Bologna in the family tomb together with his three sisters.

Isabella Colbran was a ''Spanish opera soprano and composer''
Isabella Angela Colbran was known as the muse and first wife of composer Gioachino Rossini. Isabella Colbran was born in Madrid in 1784. She started her musical studies as a singer and composer at the age of six. In 1801, Colbran and her father moved to Paris where she made her concert debut and was warmly received by Napoleon's court. Colbran's dramatic soprano voice and sizable three octave range allowed her to have an extremely successful opera career. She was described as a true dramatic soprano capable of the most elaborate coloratura (while you are reading you are hearing one of her performances). She mainly acted in grand, tragic roles. She had the advantage of a voice of exceptional compass and of striking dignity of movement and gesture Colbran's voice and sense of pitch in performance declined in 1815, but she continued to perform for many years after. She suffered from a strained voice that meant she had a hard time staying in tune. She retired from singing in 1824 and started composing shortly after. She fell ill around 1830 and she ended up living with Rossini's father Giuseppe Rossini, until her death in October 1845, caused by the disease given to her by Rossini.

At a young age she moved with her family to the province of Modena, where her grandmother had purchased the villa "La Personala" (later called Villa Frassinesi). She graduated as a kindergarten teacher and she dedicated herself to theater in the early years of the century, causing what her family initially considered almost a scandal. In 1903, she debuted at the Brunetti Theater in Bologna.
She performed all over the world accompanied by her father, who wrote operetta adaptations to suit her type of performance or wrote new texts from scratch, and by her sister Emilia Frassinesi, a skilled violinist.
In 1921, she married Count Luigi d'Arco in Bologna and had a daughter with him. She continued touring until 1932 and then she retired to private life. She died in Bologna in November 1954 from a tumor diagnosed when it was already too late.

Nicola Zanichelli was an ''Italian publisher, founder of the homonymous the publishing house''.
Nicola Zanichelli was born in Modena to a family of modest origins. He left the school and studied as self-taught because his father sent him to apprentice with the bookbinder Garruti. In 1843, he managed to purchase, along with some partners, the Vincenzi and Nephews bookstore under the portico of the Collegio. Among these partners, Giacinto Menozzi introduced Zanichelli to liberal and patriotic literature. The bookstore became a meeting place for opponents of Duke Francesco V and endured several 'visits' from the police due to the circulation of banned books.
The turning point in Zanichelli's professional life came in 1866 with the purchase of the Marsigli and Rocchi bookstore in Bologna, in the heart of the prestigious university. The move to Bologna was both a cause and a consequence of his desire to focus primarily on his publishing activities. After his death, the management of the publishing house passed to his sons Giacomo and Cesare.]

Ottorino Respighi was an'' Italian composer, violinist, teacher, and musicologist.''
He was born in Bologna to a musical and artistic family. He was encouraged by his father to pursue music at a young age, and took formal tuition in the violin and piano. He enrolled at the Liceo Musicale di Bologna, where he studied the violin, viola, and composition, and was principal violinist at the Russian Imperial Theatre (While reading you are hearing //(text-colour:red)[Sonata for violin and pianoforte]//). He became professor of composition at the Liceo Musicale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. During this period he married his pupil, singer Elsa Olivieri-Sangiacomo. In 1923, Respighi dedicated time to tour and compose. He performed and conducted in various capacities across the United States and South America until his death.
In late 1935, while composing his opera Lucrezia, Respighi became ill and died four months later. His wife Elsa outlived him for almost 60 years, championing her late husband's works and legacy until her death. His compositions range over operas, ballets, orchestral suites, choral songs, chamber music, and transcriptions of Italian compositions of the 16th–18th centuries, but his best known and most performed works are his three orchestral tone poems which brought him international fame: Fountains of Rome (1916), Pines of Rome (1924), and Roman Festivals (1928).

:: Grabinski Cell {"position":"550,1100","size":"100,100"}
The vast shrine is dedicated to the Polish General Giuseppe Grabinski and his heirs. He played a primary role in the history of Bologna in the early 19th century, both in terms of patriotism, politics and economics. It should therefore not surprise the huge marble sculpture that portrays him, the work of Carlo Chelli. The chapel and the portrait are two exceptional examples in Certosa both for the size and for the conspicuous use of marble. The sculpture and the sacellum were executed long after Grabinski’s death in 1843, and were not concluded until 1861. The overall project is due to Giuseppe Mengoni (1829-1877). The deceased is ennobled here by portraying him swamped as a hero of ancient Rome. The portrait, while true, is also idealizing because it represents him in the prime of the years and not old, just before death. This important sculpture acts as a counteraltar to the nearby one of Duprè made for the Pallavicini family, and together they represent two moments of the artistic culture of the time, suspended between classical idealization and representation as close to reality and everyday life as possible.

The architectural project of the Gregorini Bingham burial cell was approved, in July 1855, by the academic commission appointed to control the work to be carried out in the Cemetery of the Certosa, but its construction took a long time, so that in 1873 the tomb was still being built.

However, it was a fruitful wait: when, in 1875, there was placed the Desolation of Vincenzo Vela - at this date, sculptor now known and appreciated throughout Europe - the cell Gregorini Bingham became one of the most visited and admired tombs of the Certosa. 
At the center of the elegant cell, on a high stone, is placed a marble depicting a young woman sitting, with an absorbed look, her face tight in her hands, the long hair that frames her face.

Essential, unadorned, without the slightest superfluous accessory, this absorbed girl holding her face in her hands is first of all an expression of an inner, emotional truth. The first version of the Desolation, which is now in Lugano in the public park of Villa Ciani, was designed and built as a funeral monument for the parents of the patriots Filippo and Giacomo Ciani, friends and comrades of the sculptor. Exhibited at the Brera in 1851, many people read the allusion to Italy in mourning and desolation.

The project, by Filippo Buriani and Attilio Muggia, started in 1900 and was completed in the 1920s, but several changed and expansions affected the space in the 1930s. The Cloister hosts artworks from some of the best local sculptors, although its importance is also due to its historical relevance, testified by the presence of two commemorative monuments.
<h3>Monument to the Fallen of the Great War (1933)</h3>
<center><img src="https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/sites/default/files/styles/fullscreen/public/2024-01/chiostroviveduta-1.jpg" alt="Monumento ai Caduti della Grande Guerra" height="150"></center>
The project from the monument is by Filippo Buriani and Attilio Carpi, while the statues of the soldiers guarding the ossuaries are by Ercole Drei. The monument is composed of two in-ground circular bodies, connected by a corridor, and covered on the outside by two polished Istrian stone caps.  The alabaster skylights on top of the caps let a faint light in, that illuminates the inside of the two hypogeum, in which the loculi containing the remains of the fallen are placed.

<h3>Monument to the Martyrs of the Fascist Revolution (1932)</h3>
<center><img src="https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/sites/default/files/styles/fullscreen/public/2024-01/Alba_fascisti1.JPG" alt="Monumento ai Martiri della Rivoluzione Fascista" height="150"></center>
The monument was designed by the architect Giulio Ulisse Arata (1881-1962), while the allegories of Strength (left) and Glory (right) are by Ercole Drei (1886-1973). It was inaugurated on October 28th 1932, on the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome. The structure is entirely made of travertine, while the shrine takes the form of an hypogeum topped by the //Ara dei Caduti//. The monument has not been affected by any changes over time, except for the removal, after World War II, of the epigraphe on the main facade, which read: CADUTI PER IL FASCISMO / BOLOGNA MEMORE QUI LI RACCOGLIE / E LI ONORA IN ETERNO (FALLER IN THE NAME OF FASCISM / HERE GATHERED BY MINDFUL BOLOGNA / ARE HONORED FOR ETERNITY.
The Monument to the Martyrs was chronologically older than the Monument for the fallen of the Great War, but it occupies the space behind it, so that the visitor who enters the Cloister sees the tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives in the war and moves forward to the celebration of the men who died bringing Fascism to power, in an ideal continuity between Italian Independence, World War I and fascist era.

One of the most interesting is the //Madonna Gravida// (//Pregnant Madonna//) by Bartolomeo Cesi (1556-1629). Like the other paintings representing the Virgin Mary gathered in the cloister, Cesi's work comes from one of the churches abandoned by the end of XVIII century, when Napoleon took power in Italy.

This space as well was previously part of the original Carthusian monastery and its interior was turned into a celebratory space for illustrious men in 1822, to then become the hall in which secular cerimonies were celebrated in the 1990s and a contemplation space for people in mourning, regardless of their religious beliefs, with the last intervention of 2008 by Flavio Favelli.

One of the first additions to the cemetery was the new entrance, the so-called “Entrata Piangoloni”, realized in 1809 as main path for the passage of processions. The sculptures on top of the pillars were realized by Giovanni Putti (1771-1847), one of the main artists in Bologna during Napoleon's occupation and the subsequent Restauration period. The two crying women represented in the statues are a testimony of the late Baroque tendencies, especially evident in the espressionism of the faces, tempered by Putti's neoclassical taste. The veil that wraps the body of the women strengthen their allegorical values of boundary between life and death.

The Piety Hall is the former refectory of the monastery. The space was affected by massive changes in 1816, when Angelo Venturoli (1741-1821) designed a neoclassical inspired connecting staircase between the room and the basement. Venturoli is also responsible for the overall project of the //Baldi Comi Monument//, realized with the collaboration of Giovanni Putti (1771-1847) for the sculptorial component and Flaminio Minozzi and Giacomo Savini for the painted backdrop.

<center><div class="info">Benvenuti al Cimitero Monumentale della Certosa. Sono qui per farti compagnia nel tragitto fino al Cortile della Chiesa, da dove potrai iniziare la tua esperienza. Nel frattempo, goditi il silenzio di questi spazi e lascia che ti racconti qualcosa su questo posto.
La Certosa di Bologna, fondata nel 1801, è stato il primo cimitero monumentale in Italia. Le sue bellissime sale, chiostri e opere d’arte hanno attratto i viaggiatori durante il Grand Tour e sono state celebrate da numerosi autori, come Giosuè Carducci and Charles Dickens. 
Il primo nucleo del cimitero è stato edificato sull’area precedentemente occupata dal monastero certosino, chiuso nel 1796 da Napoleone. Il luogo attuale è il risultato di una stratificazione culturale che trova le sue radici nel sesto secolo avanti Cristo, quando l’area su cui il cimitero è stato eretto era usata come luogo di sepoltura dagli Etruschi.
Nel corso degli anni, il cimitero monumentale è stato interessato da diverse espansioni, in parte dovute alla necessità di accogliere credi diversi da quello cattolico. A partire dal 1833, vennero intrapresi nuovi piani per allargare il cimitero e nuovi spazi di ispirazione classica, come la Sala del Colombario, furono aggiunti all’area esistente.
Questo tipo di strutture trovò una diffusione ancora maggiore dopo l’unificazione dell’Italia, con spazi come la Galleria degli Angeli. Nel 1869, venne inaugurato il Cimitero Ebraico, mentre le necessità legate alla crescente diffusione della cremazione portò alla creazione dell’Ara crematoria e del Cinerario.
Dall’inizio del ventesimo secolo, il cimitero fu espanso verso la città, con l’edificazione dell’Ingresso Monumentale, vicino allo stadio, mentre la più consistente estensione durante il periodo fascista fu il Chiostro sesto.
L’ultima rilevante aggiunta si verificò in seguito alla Secondo Guerra Mondiale, con l’introduzione del Campo degli Ospedali, al cui centro è collocato il Monumento Ossario ai Caduti Partigiani, eretto nel 1959, e del Cimitero Moderno, nell’area occidentale della Certosa, che segna il passaggio dai monumenti funebri come memoria pubblica ai luoghi di sepoltura come memoria privata.

In 1944, Bandiera was arrested at her uncle's house, along with two other partisans while she was carrying weapons to her group's base in Castel Maggiore. They were locked up in the schools of San Giorgio. She was then transferred to Bologna, where her captors hoped to obtain further information about the Resistance from her. She was tortured for a week by the fascists of the Special Autonomous Company, but Irma resisted without speaking, thus saving her fellow partisans.
On 14 August Bandiera's body was found on the pavement near a factory. Bandiera was buried in the cemetery of the Certosa di Bologna, in the company of family and some friends.]

Vincenzo Martinelli, the most famous landscape painter in Bologna in the second half of the 18th century, died in 1807. The City offers for his burial an arch in the Cloister III. The decoration will be made by the painter Pietro Fancelli, friend and collaborator of Martinelli. The ornament is attributed to Luigi Busatti from all the oldest sources. Fancelli imagines to break through the arch with a perspective that opens onto a garden populated with cypresses and weeping willows. In the background you can see an imposing sarcophagus. In close-up, on a triclinial bed occupied in the center by a plaque with Latin inscription, is lying painting in a sad attitude, dressed in the old, who observes with brooding air the portrait of the painter within a round inscribed in a rectangular frame.

:: Memorial to those killed for Indipendence {"position":"375,1800","size":"100,100"}
The Bolognese sculptor Carlo Monari, defined as «one of the most talented sculptors of the learned Bologna», is known above all for the numerous funeral monuments - many of which are located in the cemetery of the Certosa - and commemorative; his works were at the exhibitions in Paris (1867), Rome (1880), Milan (1881) and Turin (1884). From 5 April 1868 Monari exhibited in the atrium on the ground floor of the Archiginnasio the sketch of a monument depicting a roaring lion and wounded in the act of defending the national flag for «to perpetuate the memory of the many Bolognese people who fell in the home battles and political struggles that from the beginning of the century to today troubled the resurrected nation» (a few months before the Battle of Mentana, in which Monari himself had taken part).

The young sculptor was acknowledged to have «wonderfully guessed the most effective plastic expression of the noble concept of public honour to the glorious dead who spent their lives in this Italian homeland». Prince Umberto himself, who visited the city and its ancient library on 29 April, had the opportunity to see the sculpture and to meet the author personally, to whom he «addressed courteous words of encouragement and praise». Immediately, on the impulse of the citizens' newspapers of democratic orientation, a Commission was established that promoted a subscription in order to obtain from that first work a real monument, thus giving «to that majestic figure the warm and severe shades of fawn bronze stand out on the base of the granite bigio». In fact, despite the private underwriting and a certain verbal commitment on the part of the Town Hall, it only came, and after a long time, to a definitive plaster sketch, which in 1883 was placed in the cemetery of the Certosa.

When then, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the battle, it was decided to build a large monument on the Montagnola, Monari’s work was at first chosen as a model. The Art Commission charged with examining the project, however, considered that «the Lion, as it is represented, with a wound on the side and with the flag lowered, is a defeat; while in August 8, 1848, a splendid victory was achieved by the people». In 1898 Monari presented a new draft, but even this project «was not generally appreciated», and also the City Council rejected it. In 1901 the competition for the presentation of a new sketch was finally launched; «worthy of being accepted» however, it turned out that of the young Pasquale Rizzoli.

The sculputre, depicting the King of Naples Gioacchino Murat, stands on the tomb of his daughter Letizia (1802-1859), born from Murat’s union with Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon’s younger sister. The portrait was placed here by the testamentary will of Letizia herself, who thus wished to celebrate her father, who had no burial: after the fall of the Kingdom of Naples, he was in fact executed by the Bourbons at Pizzo Calabro in 1815 and his body scattered in a mass grave. The King is depicted in his elegant military uniform, surrounded by royal and warlike trophies and symbols: the eagles of the French Empire, the cannon on which his left foot rests, the marshall’s staff in his hand. His daughter is potrayed in the simple medallion on the plinth.

The work combines the celebratory and encomiastic purpose with the Ticino sculptor Vincenzo Vela’s (1820-1891) adherence to the new verist tendencies, of which the richly detailed rendering of the uniform and the psychological connotation of the subject, proud and austere in both the pose and facial expression are an expression.
The sculpture has its ancestor in the Roman and Greek style of representing war heros. You see the terrible captain in the dignified posture of a man returning victorious from battle;  he claps the whip in his hand to show that he has recently dismounted from the horse that led him before all to meet the enemy phalanxes; he stamps his foot on an overturned cannon, the symbol of the overthrown foreign arrogance. The figure as a whole is stupendous, and if you observe it in detail, you find such evidence in every part of it, that it would have been very difficult to achieve with paint and brush.

The refined monument is designed by Antonio Cipolla, who makes use of Antonio Rossetti for the sculptures and Giuseppe Palombini for the ornaments. Rossetti engraves his own signature and the date, 1851, under the pillow on which Teodoro’s head rests. The Neapolitan architect designs other important works in Bologna, gradually involving foreign artists. These presences bring a different artistic culture to the city of Bologna, in part alternative to the classicism still declined in Bologna in a more or less Canovian sense.

To understand the cultural debate that funeral monuments like these lit, in the fourth volume of the series La Civiltà Cattolica.
"This work, which we also admired in Rome where it was carved, induces in the soul of the relative a true religious feeling. The architect Mr. Onion to the great study he placed in 'classical monuments of the sixteenth century has coupled that intimate Christian sense that is now so reasonably wanted' religious monuments. On this point especially, which he very admirably obtained, we find the particular praises given to that monument he designed. While the Christian concept is so clear and so well exposed, the architect was able to add to it the true good taste of the ancient classical style, which some without good reason would like to abolish from the Christian monuments calling it for despised pagan style.

The tomb was designed by Anna Bolelli (1897 - 1985) in memory of her husband Edoardo Weber (1885 - 1945). Designed by Augusto Panighi (1908-1979), it consists of an elliptical Carrara marble sarcophagus and a memorial stone above which is placed the marble bust depicting the deceased. Along the sarcophagus are placed a series of friezes worked at the tip, representing in its most technical aspects episodes of the industry founded by the engineer, still in operation. The narrative celebrates the theme of the work in its conceptual component. It is a frieze of clear purist connotation that puts the author in contact with the realistic climate typical of painting of the period, far from the classical rhetoric.

Clementina Gandolfi was a '' bolognese painter''.
Clementina Gandolfi was the daughter of a family of painters. 
Clementina learnt to play the piano, but her preferred artistic fields remain drawing, painting, and watercolor. In 1815, she went to Bologna where she married Giuseppe Grassilli. Intense family events went on over the years with the economic problems of Giuseppe Grassilli, which led to the failure of his business and his death in 1839, leaving Clementina with a heavy burden of responsibilities. Then she married Onofrio Zanotti, a well-known painter in the Bolognese artistic community. For Clementina painting was not a true profession but everything changed when she became an honorary member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna as an "amateur painter fond of watercolor," a title owed to her illustrious family. She exhibited a considerable number of drawings and watercolors at the Bolognese Academy: In 1842, she was mentioned among the honorary members of the Pontifical Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna as a "painter." Clementina Gandolfi died in 1848.

Dalla then wrote the lyrics of his next albums himself. The first album of this new phase was "Com'è profondo il mare" (1977). In 1979, his popularity was confirmed by the success of the Banana Republic album and the first of two self-titled albums, Lucio Dalla, followed by Dalla in 1980. The song (text-colour:red)[//Caruso//]" (that you are hearing while reading) (1986) was a big success and has been covered by numerous international artists. The 1990 hit single "Attenti al lupo" gave Dalla wider success in Europe. Dalla's main influences were to be found in jazz, but his songs ranged from folk ("Attenti al lupo") and pop ("Lunedì"), from Italian singer-songwriters (the albums from Com'è profondo il mare to Dalla) to classical and opera "Caruso".
Dalla was outed as gay after his funeral at which his longterm associate Marco Alemanno, with whom he had shared a house, spoke.
On the morning of 1 March 2012, three days before his 69th birthday, Dalla died of a heart attack, shortly after having breakfast at the hotel where he was staying in Montreux, Switzerland, having performed in the city the night before.

As you approach the final step of this journey of the macabre and the occult, a sense of dread and morbid curiosity fills the air. This is the tomb of ''Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi'', better known as ''Farinelli'', the most famous //castrato singer// in history. Born in 1705, his life was marked by both unparalleled fame and profound melancholy.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Carlo Broschi was subjected to a gruesome procedure that would define his destiny. Castrated before puberty to preserve his high-pitched voice, he endured a surgery that involved the (text-style:"underline")[removal of his testicles.] Performed between the ages of seven and twelve, this brutal intervention often used opium to dull the pain, or induced a coma by pressing on the carotid artery. The risks were severe: infection, haemorrhage, and sometimes death. Those who survived, like Farinelli, emerged with(text-style:"underline")[ altered bone development] and a larynx that retained its prepubescent characteristics.

Farinelli's voice, preserved through this cruel act, brought him immense fame. He became one of the most celebrated opera singers of his time, wielding significant influence over courts and politics. Yet, despite his public triumphs, his private life was a tapestry of solitude and sorrow. The unnatural manipulation of his body left him plagued by loneliness and an unending sense of loss.

But that's not all..

Now you are in the presence of the imposing monument dedicated to ''Senator Girolamo Legnani'', a member of one of Bologna’s most ancient and noble families. Girolamo Legnani died at the age of 84 from "sulfurization of humors in the chest" (presumably pleurisy) on August 30, 1805. With his death, the Legnani family became extinct, as his only son, Filippo, had died at a young age.

Legnani's monument, enriched with (text-style:"underline")[esoteric and Masonic imagery], reflects a culture that, at times, stood in opposition to the temporal power of the church. 
The Egyptian symbols here are not mere decorations; they are a testament to a deep fascination with ancient wisdom and the mysteries of life and death.

Your exploration of Certosa leads you to the ''Pepoli Monument'', a site surronded by mystery and deception. Contrary to nineteenth-century sources claiming it commemorates the octogenarian Marchesa Caterina Caprara Pepoli, who also rests there according to the epitaph, archival documents reveal a different truth.

The monument was commissioned by Marchese Guido Taddeo Pepoli in memory of his first wife, the Ancona-born Geltrude Trionfi, who tragically passed away at the age of thirty in 1818.

The memorial you now observe features busts of the couple on either side of their daughter Giuseppina Gargano.

Your path through the eerie and occult depths of Certosa now leads you to the tomb of ''Olindo Guerrini''. Known for his(text-style:"underline")[ inclination for the horrific, the macabre, and the excessive] in his poetry, Guerrini met his end due to throat cancer on October 22, 1916.

Guerrini's unsettling verse, particularly in his <span style="color: darkviolet;">"''Canto dell’Odio''"</span> (The song of hate), directed at a gentle lady who rejected his advances, conjures vivid images of (text-style:"underline")[revenge and despair]. He imagines uncover her tomb, cursing her name, and sealing her fate with haunting words: //"Here I make you die again, oh accursed, slowly being pierced with pins, and your shame, my vengeance, between your eyes I seal."//

As you approach Guerrini's monument, an hunting aura envelops you. His restless spirit seems to linger, whispering tales of vengeance and despair. The air thickens with the weight of his morbid obsessions and the echoes of his unsettling poetry. Are you prepared to delve into this tormented and hate-filled poetry?

THE SONG OF HATE

As you shall sleep forgotten
under the waxy soil
and the cross of God shall stand upright
infixed above your spoils

As both your cheeks shall melt in rot
over your shaky teeth
and in the foetid vacuum of your orbs
maggots shall swarm and breed

For you that slumber, which to most is peace
shall be renewed torment
and a remorse shall come, steadfast and cold
to fret upon your brain.

A remorse, the sharpest and most cruel, shall
come over your burial
in spite of God, and in spite of his cross
to gnaw upon your bones.

I shall be that remorse. I, seeking you
in the dark of the night
Lamia who shuns the morn, shall come and howl
as would howl a she-wolf;

I shall with mine own nails dig up the earth
by your virtue made dung
and split asunder the foul planks which hold
your infamous carrion.

Ah, how in your heart still vermillion shall
I quench the hate of old
Ah, with what joy shall I protrude my claw
into your shameless womb!

On your putrescent belly, nestled up
I shall forever dwell
A specter of vengeance and sin, a
monstrosity from hell;

And at your ear, which was so fair, shall I
whisper insatiable
sayings which shall set your brain on fire
like glowing hot iron

When you shall ask: why do you sting me, and
drench me with your poison?
I shall respond: don't you remember your
hair, which looked so awesome?

Don't you recall the plentiful blond mane
falling upon your chest
and eyes of blackest tint, and bottomless
sparkled by yellow flames?

And the audacities of your bosom, the
opulence of the hip?
Don't you recall how beautiful you were
provocative, and pale?

But are you not then that who her naked breasts
exposed to public eyes
and, foaming Licisca, made her own bed
into a true traffic hub?

Are you not the one who drunks and soldiers
welcomed in her embrace
lowered herself to unspeakable kisses
yet laughed upon my face?

And as I loved you, and fell upon my knees
in front of you, and, you see
when you looked at me I only wanted
to die under your feet

Why deny - to me, who loved you so - a
gentle glance, when for you
I would have made myself a slave, I would
have made myself depraved?

Why did you say no, when crawling at your
feet I implored your mercy
while your pimps out in the street awaited
for the next batch of Brits?

You laughed? Now listen! Up from the cave grave
this sinful corpse of yours
your naked flesh so much I adored
I am nailing to the pillory

And the pillory are those verses, whereas I condemn you
to eternal blame, and punishments
so harsh that you shall long
for those dispensed in hell.

Here shall you ever die a new death, oh accursed
slowly being pierced with pins
and with your shame, my vengeance
between your eyes I seal.

IL CANTO DELL'ODIO 
Quando tu dormirai dimenticata
sotto la terra grassa
e la croce di Dio sarà piantata
ritta sulla tua cassa
quando ti coleran marcie le gote
entro i denti malfermi
e nelle occhiaie tue fetenti e vuote
brulicheranno i vermi,
per te quel sonno che per altri è pace
sarà strazio novello
e un rimorso verrà freddo, tenace,
a morderti il cervello.
Un rimorso acutissimo e atroce
verrà nella tua fossa
a dispetto di Dio, della sua croce,
a rosicchiarti l'ossa.
Io sarò quel rimorso.
Io te cercando
entro la notte cupa
lamia che fugge il dì, verrò latrando
come latra una lupa;
io con quest'ugne scaverò la terra
per te fatta letame
e il turpe legno schioderò che serra
la tua carogna infame.
Oh, come nel tuo core ancor vermiglio
sazierò l'odio antico,
oh, con che gioia affonderò l'artiglio
nel tuo ventre impudico!
Sul tuo putrido ventre accoccolato
io poserò in eterno,
spettro della vendetta e del peccato,
spavento dell'inferno:
ed all'orecchio tuo che fu sì bello
sussurrerò implacato
detti che bruceranno il tuo cervello
come un ferro infuocato.
Quando tu mi dirai: perché mi mordi
e di velen m'imbevi?
Io ti risponderò: non ti ricordi
che bei capelli avevi?
Non ti ricordi dei capelli biondi
che ti coprian le spalle
e degli occhi nerissimi, profondi,
pieni di fiamme gialle?
E delle audacie del tuo busto
e dell'opulenza dell'anca?
Non ti ricordi più com'eri bella,
provocatrice e bianca?
Ma non sei dunque tu che nudo il petto
agli occhi altrui porgesti
e, spumante Licisca, entro al tuo letto
passar la via facesti?
Ma non sei tu che agli ebbri ed ai soldati
spalancasti le braccia,
che discendesti a baci innominati
e a me ridesti in faccia?
Ed io t'amavo, ed io ti son caduto
pregando innanzi e, vedi,
quando tu mi guardavi, avrei voluto
morir sotto ai tuoi piedi.
Perché negare - a me che pur t'amavo -
uno sguardo gentile,
quando per te mi sarei fatto schiavo,
mi sarei fatto vile?
Perché m'hai detto no quando carponi
misericordia chiesi
e sulla strada intanto i tuoi lenoni
aspettavan gli inglesi?
Hai riso? Senti! Dal sepolcro cavo
questa tua rea carogna,
nuda la carne tua che tanto amavo
l'inchiodo sulla gogna,
e son la gogna i versi ov'io ti danno
al vituperio eterno,
a pene che rimpianger ti faranno
le pene dell'inferno.
Qui rimorir ti faccio, oh maledetta,
piano a colpi di spillo,
e la vergogna tua, la mia vendetta
tra gli occhi ti sigillo.

The <span style="color: darkviolet;">''sphinx''</span>, a prominent figure in this tomb, stands as a guardian of temples, necropolises, and city gates in ancient Egypt. In classical times, it evolved into a symbol of enigma and cruelty, deeply associated with the cult of the dead. The sphinx here evokes the (text-style:"underline")[stages of human life, the passage of time, and the profound mysteries of existence]. In Masonic symbolism, the sphinx is a frequent motif, embodying esoteric knowledge and the quest for enlightenment.

The <span style="color: darkviolet;">''skull''</span>—a stark reminder of (text-style:"underline")[mortality]—serves instead to call souls to contemplation of the fleeting nature of earthly life. It symbolizes penance and the need for spiritual reflection and redemption.

Nearby, the <span style="color: darkviolet;">''Alpha and Omega''</span>, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolize(text-style:"underline")[ the divine and the cosmos]. This ancient symbol, used since the Hellenistic period and adopted in Judeo-Christian tradition, speaks of God's omnipresence, the beginning and the end of all things.

''An entrepreneur of modest origins,'' Renato Dall'Ara was born in Reggio Emilia in  1892  and moved to Bologna in order to start a knitwear company that made him wealthy. In 1934, he was appointed as president of football club Bologna.During the first years of his presidency, between 1934 and 1941, the team (led by the Hungarian coach Árpád Weisz) won four league titles and the Coupe des Nations in Paris in 1937. In the postwar years, Dall'Ara was unable to repeat the previous successes, until the beginning of the 1960s, when Bologna won the Mitropa Cup in 1961. In the 1963 Serie A, Bologna and Inter Milan were about to play the Championship tie-breaker in June 1964; however, four days before the match Dall'Ara died in Milan from a heart attack while he was in the Lega Calcio headquarters for a meeting with Angelo Moratti in preparation for that match. Dall'Ara was buried in the Certosa di Bologna along with his wife. The stadium of Bologna, Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, was named after him. He was added to the Italian Football Hall of Fame in 2017.
